        This survey and project aim to better understand how the Black community
        interacts with clinical trials and the research space. Historical
        realities have destroyed the trust between the Black community,
        researchers and physicians. We aim not only to understand the specific
        issues that surround this community, but we want to increase
        representation. The goal is to create a registry of individuals who are
        interested, willing, and able to join us in our mission to diversify
        clinical trials!
